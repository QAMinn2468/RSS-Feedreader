### Footnotes

This is the fourth project for the Grow with Google Scholarship of the Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree.  

All code is my own.  In my research (because not all tools needed are provided by Udacity), I reviewed documentation by Jasmine, MND, W3schools, and Matthew Cranford. I have deleted the commit I made after reading Matthew's work. I will consider walkthroughs and articles about projects I have not completed to be tainted and to be studiously avoided. I feel betrayed that those same walkthroughs are brilliant and inspired and display a real gift for teaching, but to partake of those gifts and learn from them, results in discipline and threat of expulsion.

Enjoy!
